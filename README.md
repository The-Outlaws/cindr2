Cindr is a choose-your-own-adventure style dating app. Cindr can be used to find a date or a friend!

Upon signup, users will be served a series of storyline style questions. After answering their questions, users will arrive in a room with people who answered their own questions similarly.

Instead of filling out lengthy profiles with basic information, users are matched based on an interactive experience that gives insight to their personality.

Cindr stack: Phaser3, React, Redux, Node, Express, PostreSQL, Sequelize, Socket.io.
